# Avra Labs Eye Control

Avra Labs Eye Control is a mouse replacement designed to help people with arm difficulties use Windows with their eyes. It currently works with Tobii eye-trackers and uses the OptiKey on-screen keyboard for typing. This project is provided for free with the intention of helping people to use computers, as well as to support technological advancement in the eye-tracking and AAC fields.  

# User Experience Enhancements
Noteworthy enhancements tested to be more intuitive and productive compared to other software alternatives include:
* Calibration animation that's easier for users to complete, takes 10 seconds, and improves accuracy by about 3x compared to other calibration animation methods
* Click-to-zoom: first click is always a zoombox, 2nd click will apply the click operation (left or right click)
* Dwell-drop-scroll: when multiple scrollbars are present on the screen, this allows dropping a "scroll icon" at a dwell point and scrolling is performed automatically for the user
* Automatic on-screen keyboard: Similar to Android/iOS, when an input box is clicked, the on-screen keyboard automatically appears
* Hidden cursor and thus the screen doesn't hover/light-up everywhere you look
